The Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) algorithm using Dynamic Programming efficiently finds the optimal order of multiplying a chain of matrices while minimizing the number of scalar multiplications. It avoids repeatedly solving the same subproblems by storing their results in a DP table.
Time Complexity: O(n³)
There are three nested loops over the matrix chain.
Space Complexity: O(n²)
The DP table m requires an n × n matrix.
